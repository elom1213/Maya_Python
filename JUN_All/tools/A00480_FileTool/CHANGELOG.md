# Changelog — A00480_FileTool

## v01.01 (2026-09-17)
- The window now opens at the same size as `A00040_file_exporter_V02`
  (960 x 853 with slate_dark). v01.00 measured its size before the theme reached
  the child widgets and opened at about 1290 x 890.
  - The size is fitted to the layout minimum on the event loop right after show().
  - Export tab page margins removed, window side margins reduced by the tab
    frame, Pin button height 22 so the header row matches the menu bar.

## v01.00 (2026-09-17)
- New tool: file import / export / path helpers in one window, three tabs.
  - **Export** — the whole `A00040_file_exporter_V02` (v02.09) window: Export Path
    (Browse / Paste), Set Up, Naming tokens, Move to scene root, Joints only under
    joints, Type Filter. Same results as the original (same files, same FBX
    contents, same log lines).
  - **Import** — `Import FBX normal` from `A00030_quickTool_V02`.
  - **Path** — `Copy Scene Folder` / `Open Scene Folder` from `A00030_quickTool_V02`.
- NEW **Scene** button next to the export path: fills it with the current scene's
  folder (an unsaved scene leaves the path unchanged and logs a warning).
- Export now loads the FBX plugin up front; without it the export logs
  `[FAIL] Cannot export FBX without the plugin.` instead of raising.
- One shared log for all tabs, Pin (always on top), common menu bar.
- Internal: the pasted-path cleanup moved from the UI into
  `core.normalize_pasted_path`; the exporter's private `undo_chunk` copy was
  replaced by `Framework.core.maya_undo.undo_chunk`.
- The two source tools are untouched and can run side by side with this one.
